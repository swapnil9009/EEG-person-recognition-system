# EEG-person-recognition-system
Developed a person recognition model using EEG signals, commonly known as brainwave. Random Forest has been employed as a classifier and Power spectral density is being used to extract the signal power and relevant neural information. Model has been trained on 10 runs of 6 different tasks and 4 runs are used as a test data to evaluate the model.
